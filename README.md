# Decision-Tree
 Decision Tree is a popular machine learning Classification algorithm. We will use this classification algorithm to build a model from historical data of patients, and their response to different medications. Then we can use the trained decision tree to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to find and predict the proper drug for a new patient
