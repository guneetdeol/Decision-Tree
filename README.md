# Decision-Tree
 Decision Tree is a popular machine learning algorithm. We will use this classification algorithm(i.e Decision Trees) to build a model from historical data of patients, and their response to different medications. Then we can use the trained decision tree to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.
